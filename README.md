```
Phase 1: Initial Access

└─ Successful authentication

Phase 2: Reconnaissance
├─ Get-Process (identify security tools, running processes)
├─ Get-WmiObject (enumerate software, find vulnerabilities)
└─ listdlls.exe (analyze DLL loading for hijacking)

Phase 3: Privilege Escalation Preparation
├─ Target identified: perl.exe (C:\Strawberry\perl\bin\)
├─ Malicious payload downloaded from attacker's server
└─ Legitimate perl.exe replaced with malicious binary

Phase 4: Trap Set (Waiting for Admin)
├─ Admin executes Perl script: perl.exe backup.pl
├─ Malicious binary runs with admin privileges
└─ Attacker gains administrator access

Root Cause: Weak password + No account lockout + No MFA + 
            Excessive file permissions + No application whitelisting
```

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Windows Event Log forensics
- PowerShell command history analysis
- Brute force attack detection

- Hardened file permissions (admin-only for system executables)
- Proposed EDR and SIEM deployment

**Security Controls Failed:** 8 layers (password, lockout, MFA, file permissions, whitelisting, FIM, EDR, SIEM) - demonstrating why defense-in-depth is critical.
